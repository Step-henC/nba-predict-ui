# Predict Stats UI

Consumes [NBA stats from this API](https://github.com/nprasad2077/nbaStats) and communicates with java backend
[here](https://github.com/Step-henC/nba-predict-api) to perform linear regression in backend and predict a player's performance for next season. Ideal for fantasy drafts or sports fanatics.

Will eventually incorporate other sports.

Also uses [this Component Library](https://github.com/Step-henC/predict-component-library)

# Future Directions


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
